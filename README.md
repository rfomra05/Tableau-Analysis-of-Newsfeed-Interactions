# Tableau-Analysis-of-Newsfeed-Interactions

## Executive Summary

This Newsfeed Analysis project leverages Tableau to analyze user interaction data on the 365 platform's Newsfeed service, focusing on engagement metrics for both automated and manual posts. The objective was to assess which post types resonate most with users and provide data-driven recommendations for enhancing engagement. Key findings showed that Level-type and Collection-type posts are the least favored, despite their prevalence, suggesting the need to rethink content strategy for the Newsfeed. By optimizing post types and prioritizing engaging content, the platform can increase user satisfaction, boost engagement rates, and potentially drive higher course subscriptions.

## Business Problem

The 365 platform’s Newsfeed is a critical feature designed to drive user engagement by showcasing achievements, sharing milestones, and posting insights. However, engagement rates on the platform were lower than expected. The business problem was to determine why certain post types were not resonating with users and how this could be improved. Understanding these patterns could help optimize the content being posted, ensuring the Newsfeed encourages prolonged usage and boosts interaction, which would ultimately drive course renewals and platform subscriptions.

## Methodology

1. Data Extraction and Analysis: I worked with data from the 365 platform’s Newsfeed between January 1, 2023, and May 31, 2023, and used Tableau to generate a series of dashboards.
2. Key Visualizations: Created visualizations to analyze user interactions (e.g., likes, post counts) for different post types and tracked user engagement.
3. Statistical Insights: Used the post distribution and engagement graphs to identify trends in user behavior.

## Skills
Tableau: Designed custom dashboards to visualize data effectively, including user engagement metrics and post-type breakdowns.

Data Analysis: Analyzed large datasets from the 365 platform using Tableau’s advanced filtering, sorting, and aggregation techniques.

Data-Driven Recommendations: Leveraged insights from the visualizations to recommend strategies for optimizing the Newsfeed feature.

## Results & Business Recommendations

1. Engagement Metrics: The overall engagement rate was low, with just 10% of visitors interacting with the Newsfeed. The Level-type and Collection-type posts, despite being the most frequently posted, had the lowest interaction, with only 0.02 likes per post.
2. Post-Type Saturation: The Level-type posts dominated the Newsfeed, accounting for 22,313 posts, but they were among the least engaging.
3. Actionable Recommendations: Reduce the frequency of Level-type posts and prioritize content that historically drives more likes, such as Certificate or Career Track posts. Focus on quality over quantity, ensuring the Newsfeed highlights posts that foster user interaction. By adjusting the content mix, the platform can boost user engagement and improve the overall experience, leading to longer session durations and higher subscription renewals.

## Next Steps

1. Content Optimization: Experiment with featuring more engaging post types (e.g., Career Track Certificates) at the top of the feed and monitor how user interaction changes.
2. A/B Testing: Conduct A/B tests with different content strategies to identify which combination of automated and manual posts leads to higher user engagement.
3. User Feedback Survey: Implement a feedback loop by surveying users on which posts they find most valuable, allowing the platform to tailor content accordingly.
